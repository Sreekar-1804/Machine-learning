# 🧠 Machine Learning Regression Project

## 📋 Overview
This project focuses on developing and evaluating regression models to predict continuous target values using structured data.  
The notebook walks through the complete end-to-end data science workflow — from data exploration to model tuning — demonstrating practical ML implementation using Python.

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to **predict a continuous numerical outcome** based on given input features.  
This involves understanding feature relationships, handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and optimizing models for better predictive performance.

## 🧩 Dataset
The dataset contains mixed numerical and categorical features representing user interactions, behavioral metrics, and contextual attributes.  
It was provided as part of a machine learning coursework challenge (academic/Kaggle-style dataset).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **NumPy** – numerical computations  
- **Pandas** – data manipulation and cleaning  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – model training, preprocessing, and evaluation  
- **XGBoost** – advanced regression modeling and hyperparameter tuning  

## 🔍 Key Steps in the Project
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Examined distributions, correlations, and outliers  
   - Visualized relationships between key variables  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values using `SimpleImputer`  
   - Applied One-Hot and Target Encoding for categorical variables  
   - Scaled numerical features where required  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Removed single-value columns  
   - Identified important predictors  

4. **Model Building & Evaluation**  
   - Built and compared multiple regression models including:
     - Linear Regression  
     - Random Forest Regressor  
     - Decision Tree Regressor  
     - XGBoost Regressor  
   - Evaluated models using **R² score** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   - Performed tuning using `RandomizedSearchCV` for XGBoost to optimize performance  

6. **Final Model & Results**  
   - Selected **XGBoost Regressor** as the final model  
   - Achieved an **R² score of approximately 0.7–0.8** on validation data  

## 📈 Results Summary
| Model | R² Score | Remarks |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Linear Regression | ~0.45 | Baseline model |
| Random Forest | ~0.68 | Strong generalization |
| XGBoost | **~0.78** | Best-performing model |
